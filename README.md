# Math-Interpreter-using-Python
This is Math Interpreter build using Python programming language. An interpreter works in a sequential manner. Similarly, this math interpreter works in a sequential manner. Math interpreter is a simple interpreter which takes input (mathematical expressions sequentially and generate output in the form of tokens, parse tree and the value of that mathematical expression. In this project, there are four major parts:

- **File Handling:** File handling in Python where input and output text files are used.
- **Lexical Analysis:** Lexical analysis using lexer.py file.
- **Parsing:** Tokenization using the \_parser.py file.
- **Interpreter:** Interpreter to evaluate the value of a mathematical expression.

The more details about the project are in the [**Report of this project**](https://github.com/SagarSikchi/Math-Interpreter-using-Python/blob/main/MATH%20INTERPRETER_REPORT.pdf). This is the course project for course **System Programming**. System Programming is the art of designing and implementing the system programs.
